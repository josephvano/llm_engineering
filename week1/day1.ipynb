Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell.

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "As someone with experience in the software industry, you might be familiar with terms like \"autonomous systems\" or \"agent-based systems.\" However, I'd like to introduce you to \"agentic AI,\" which is a fascinating field that combines computer science and social sciences.\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can take actions based on its own goals, intentions, and motivations, similar to human agents. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are typically programmed to perform specific tasks or follow predefined rules, agentic AI aims to develop autonomous entities that can decide their own objectives and behave in complex, dynamic environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "The term \"agentic\" was coined by philosopher John Searle in 1983, who argued that true agency requires not just rational decision-making but also a sense of self-awareness, embodiment, and the ability to feel pleasure, pain, or other emotions. In AI research, agentic models seek to replicate these human-like qualities by creating agents that can interact with their environment, adapt to changing conditions, and make decisions based on their own internal motivations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI systems typically incorporate multiple aspects, including:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Cognitive architectures**: These provide the computational framework for the agent's decision-making process, allowing it to integrate data from various sources, reason about its goals, and plan its actions.\n",
       "2. **Self-awareness and embodiment**: This aspect enables the agent to perceive itself as existing in a specific environment, with its own body and sensory experiences, which informs its actions and decisions.\n",
       "3. **Goal-directed behavior**: The agent's objectives are shaped by its internal state, learning processes, and interactions with its surroundings.\n",
       "\n",
       "The benefits of agentic AI include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Human-like decision-making**: Agentic AI systems can approach complex problems with human-like intuition and creativity.\n",
       "* **Adaptability**: These agents can learn from their experiences, adapt to changing circumstances, and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n",
       "* **Autonomy**: Agentic AI offers the potential for decentralized decision-making, reducing dependence on central controllers or human oversight.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, agentic AI also raises important questions about:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Value alignment**: How do we ensure that these autonomous agents align with our values and goals?\n",
       "* **Control and safety**: Can we effectively control or limit the actions of an agent with its own goals and motivations?\n",
       "\n",
       "As you navigate your career in software development, understanding agentic AI can help you stay at the forefront of emerging technologies and their societal implications. How would you like to explore this concept further?"

    "You may notice that if you try `display_summary(\"https://openai.com\")` - it doesn't work! That's because OpenAI has a fancy website that uses Javascript. There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
